            are
            sure to be a hit with any apple loving lady or lad.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 sheet of perfectly flaky pie crust dough</li>
            <li>6 honeycrisp apples, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 Tbsps butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>sprinkles of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger</li>
            <li>5 Tbsps apricot jam</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Instructions</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Chill a mini muffin tin while preparing dough. Roll out on a lightly
               floured
               surface the pie dough and, using a 3-inch cookie cutter, punch out rounds.
               Remove
               muffin tin from refrigerator and gently press rounds into each well.
               Transfer pie
               crust-lined tin back to refrigerator as you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>Core the applies. Using a very sharp knife, cut the apples into half moon
               slices. Place slices in a large bowl, and then add the lemon juice, tossing
               to
               coat.</li>
            <li>Place the brown sugar, jam, spices, and butter in a small saucepan over
               medium-low heat.
               Stir and cook until ingredients are melted and combined. Pour mixture over
               apple
               slices and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Set apples asied for 10-15 minutes to become pliable and then strain apple
               slices and discard liquid.</li>
            <li>To form roses, arrange about 8 apple slices in a straight row with each
               slice
               overlapping one another to create a 12 inch lin. Starting with one end,
               gently
               role apples up into a rose shape.</li>

            <li>Transfer rolled apples into the pie crust tins until they are all full.
               Refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&degF and arrange rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
            <li>Mix honey with a splash of water and lightly brush on top of tartlets.
            </li>
            <li>Bake tartlets until the crust is golden and the apples have fully cooked,
               about
               30 minutes. Wait to cool and then dig in!</li>

         <img src="images/pumpkinstew.jpg" style="width:550px;height:400px; alt=" Pumpkin
            stew inside of a baked pumpkin">
         <p>During her adventure, Cinderella learned that pumpkins can be formed into all
            sorts of special things, like a horse-drawn carriage built to take her to her
            destiny. But you won't need a fairy godmother or a magic spell to turn a
            pumpkin into the edible serving dish for this hearty autumn recipe.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 3- to 4-lb pumpkin, either sugar pie, kabocha, or buttercup squash</li>

         <h2><a id="cake">Little Red Riding Hood's Health Restoring Citrus Almond Cake</a>
         </h2>
         <img src="images/ridinghoodcake.jpg" style="width:550px;height:600px;
            alt=" Iced cake, topped with orange flowers, and a slice taken out">
         <p>Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her with a picnic basket full of cake and
            wine to cure her ailing grandmother. Though her journey didn't go quite as
            planned, cake and wine remain fool proof pickmeups for when you're feeling
            down. This cake, with a nip of wine to go with it, will be a big hit with
            your grandmother included.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 stick of butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tsps orange blossom water</li>
            <li>1 orange, zested</li>
            <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tsps baking powder</li>
            <li>1 Tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 Tsp almond extract</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Instructions</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&degF. Grease and line an 8 inch round pan with
               parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the sugar and orange zest. Using your fingers,
               massage the zest into the sugar to release the oil from the orange zest.
            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs and almond extract and whisk for 1 minute, until fully
               combined. Add the olive oil and yogurt and mix everything together.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, sift in the dry ingredients: almond flour, all purpose
               flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients into
               the wet ingredients and mix just until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the greased cake pan. Place the pan on the middle
               oven rack and bake for about 40 minutes, until golden all over and a
               toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>While cake is baking, combine juice of an orange and powdered sugar and
               whisk together until the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour glaze over cooled cake and allow it drip over the sides. Garnish with
               fresh flours and serve with a hearty pour of wine.</li>
